              <h1>Spectrum Sales Tracking</h1>
              <h4>Course Project - Improving sales and personal growth at Spectrum</h4>
            </div>
            <p>In this project, my group and I applied design thinking to create an “Internal-Use-Only” iOS sales tracking app for Spectrum–an internet, cable and mobile service provider. The purpose of the app is to provide commission based employees with the tools they need to succeed in a highly competitive environment, and grant retail managers the ability to track overall store sales for increased transparency and autonomy.

            <h2>Two End Users In Mind</h2>
            <h4>Our Approach</h4>
            <p>
            The Spectrum Sales Tracking app was designed specifically for employees who are actively on the retail floor: the 'Retail Sales Specialist' & 'Retail Store Manager'. As a result, two unique user personas were created to solve differing friction points.
            <br><br>
            </p>
            <h4>Research & Interviews</h4>
            <p>As a group, we created a list of 30+ questions and conducted 8 in-person user interviews with commission based employees across different industries. <br><br>As a result, we were able to compare and contrast the differences in user goals and pain points to help prioritize features to include in our sales tracking app.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class = "col-sm-none col-lg-1">
            <span class= "spacer"></span>

      </div>

      <div class = "row">
        <div class = "col-sm-none col-lg-1">
          <span class= "spacer"></span>
        </div>
        <div class = "col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-5">
          <h2>Competition and Compromises</h2>
          <h4>Findings & Affinity Mapping</h4>
          <p>Common through lines we found through our interviews were how compeitive a career in commission base sales can be and how the employees thrived in that environment. Competition was a huge motivator for our users, as well as being in control of their own success.
          <br><br>
          However, another distinctive motivator we discovered was the importance of helping the customer. By having that service mindset, employees at times felt a moral dilemma when the employees themselves did not support the product they were selling.

          <h2>One Tool, Multiple Users</h2>
          <h4>Matt Davis - Young and Eager Optimist</h4>
          <p>Matt is a recent college graduate and new 'Retail Store Specialist' at Spectrum. Even though he has little-to-no experience in sales, he is a very charismatic and positive individual with aspirations to starting his own business one day. Matt views this new job opportunity as a great way to network and gain consumer facing sales experience.</p><br><br>
          <h4>Rachel Keer - Productive and Balanced Parent</h4>
          <p>Rachel is an 'Assistant Store Manager' at her local Spectrum retail store. Coming from a real estate background, she is used to sales and customer interactions but did not enjoy the long hours it took to be successful in that industry. As a parent, her priorities has changed and values a strong work/life balance where she can truly disconnect when at home.

            <p>Low fidelity wireframes were done to roughly and quickly ideate the main features and pages of the app. Further refinement and user testing was done for the mid-fidelity wireframes using Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) and iOS 16 UI Kit for Figma.<br><br>

              <h4>Tracking Employee Performances</h4>
              <p>For a Spectrum retail manager, empowering an employee is an important dynamic for the store's overall success.
              <br><br>
              The Spectrum Sales Tracking app allows for Rachel and other managers to filter the top and bottom performers by different metrics, such as CVR, AOV and Lead generation.
              <br><br>
              The app also allows for further investigation into the employees to better understand why they may be underperforming, i.e. able to review training completion, employee and manager notes, and overall performance graphs.

              <p>One of Rachel's goals was to get promoted beyond an Associate Manager, so it was important to include a way for her to easily read or watch educational tutorials when there was any downtime at the store.<br><br>Similar to the employee's user flow, once the educational tutorials are completed, they are tracked and can be used to showcase growth in the next employee review cycle.</p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <h4>Talking to the Experts</h4>
          <p>There is limit on how much I can learn about any topic or industry at home. It takes getting out of my comfort zone and talking to people within the industry I am researching in. Those initial interviews I conducted really dictated the needs, concerns and future features of the Spectrum Sales Tracking app. Ultimately, it gave me a human connection to the work I was doing.
          </p><br>
          <h4>Laser Focused on Personas</h4>
          <p>Throughout this project, I found myself checking the User Personas constantly. Whenever I had to make any decision on what direction I should take, either with graphics, content placing, or user flows, it was always helpful to go back and review the goals, fears, needs and pain points from our two personas, Matt and Rachel.
